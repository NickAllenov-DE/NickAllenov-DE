### My name is Nikolai Allenov, and I am a Data Analyst / Data Engineer with a unique combination of rich experience in medicine and deep knowledge in the field of data processing and analysis.  
My experience as a doctor has allowed me to develop analytical thinking, attention to detail and problem-solving abilities, which I now apply to the field of data.  
Realizing the growing importance of data in the modern world, I underwent professional retraining in Data Engineering and Data Analysis, which allowed me to master modern technologies and data processing tools for working with large datasets.  

My education includes:  
    1. Higher medical education.  
    2. Higher legal education.  
    3. Professional retraining in Data Analysis/Data Engineering.  
    
During my training, I gained proficiency with tools such as Python, SQL, Docker, Apache Airflow, Apache Spark and many others. I have developed several projects, including:  
    â€¢ Data management systems (phone books, task managers) using Python.  
    â€¢ Telegram bots and Python games.  
    â€¢ Development and management of databases using SQL (triggers, transactions, views).  
    â€¢ Data analysis and and processing of large datasets using Spark and PySpark.  
    â€¢ The "Data Engineering in Medicine" project, where I applied machine learning to collect and mark up medical data.   

My medical experience gives me a unique understanding of working with data, where accuracy and interpretation are important.  
In the medical field, I see great potential in applying data-driven approaches, the introduction of machine learning and artificial intelligence methods in order to improve human health and well-being through innovation and an analytical approach.  
Looking forward, I plan to develop in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence, using these technologies to improve processes in medicine and other industries.  
I am looking for interesting and useful practical tasks that will allow me to grow and develop.  
I am eager to tackle challenging and impactful projects, where I can leverage my experience to innovate and make a meaningful difference.
